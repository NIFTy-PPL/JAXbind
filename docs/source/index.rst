JAXbind Manual
==============

Welcome to the JAXbind documentation!

The existing interface in JAX for connecting custom code requires deep knowledge of JAX and its C++ backend.
The aim of `JAXbind` is to drastically lower the burden of connecting custom functions implemented in other programming languages to JAX.
Specifically, `JAXbind` provides an easy-to-use Python interface for defining custom, so-called JAX primitives supporting any JAX transformations.
